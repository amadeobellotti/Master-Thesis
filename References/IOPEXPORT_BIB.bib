  abstract={This paper describes a new type of primary reference standard for coaxial line impedance measurements at millimetre-wave frequencies. The standard can be used to calibrate vector network analysers (VNAs) and other forms of reflection/transmission measuring instrument. The standard is intended for use in the 'small' precision coaxial line sizes—i.e. 1.85 mm and 1 mm. Fabrication and the subsequent use of the standard to calibrate a VNA in the 1.85 mm line size are described. The standard consists of an air dielectric open-circuit offset by a known length of precision coaxial line. This type of device is considered to be a primary reference standard since its electrical characteristics can be predicted from fundamental electromagnetic theory and can be traceable directly to SI base quantities (i.e. the metre and the second).}

The transformer has a 1:1 winding ratio, capacitor arrangement is symmetrical and measurements are made with a substitution technique. The operating frequency is 10 kHz. Capacitance resolution is 2 aF, which is equal to a relative sensitivity of 2 parts in 10 8 . As a test of the performance of the instrument, the relative permittivity of pure nitrogen was measured at 25, 35, and 45°C. The results, reduced to 20°C and 101 325 Pa were identical within any single standard deviation. An estimation of possible systematic errors leads to a final absolute value of ε r for nitrogen at 20°C and 101 325 Pa of ε r = 1 + (547.3 ± 0.3) × 10 -6 .}

The modulation wavelength is determined by reference to cavity resonators, used in such a manner that no atmospheric refractive index correction has to be applied. This leads to a very simple method of obtaining the required distance directly in feet. The theory of the method is given in detail, including the effect of altitude on the measurement. The apparatus itself is also described together with some preliminary results which illustrate the accuracy that can be achieved.}

The beam is returned from a distant reflector to the modulator at which the ellipticity is either increased or cancelled. A knowledge of the speed of light and the modulation frequency serves for the derivation of the modulation wavelength; the distance from reflector to modulator is then obtained in terms of the number of modulation wavelengths in it.}

Values are obtained for pairs selected from the alkali metals, the inert gases, H, H - , He + and Li + and are then employed to assess the accuracy of various approximate formulae. Where possible, comparison is made with experimental data and it is shown that the polarizabilities derived from molecular beam measurements are unreliable. A discussion is given of the measurements of elastic scattering of the alkali metals by the inert gases and it is concluded that the normal van der Waals interaction does not suffice to explain the observations at very low scattering angles.}

  abstract={New determinations have been made of the dielectric constants of benzene, cyclohexane, dichlorethane and nitrobenzene with the object of providing values of a higher accuracy than has hitherto been available for four standard liquids covering the range of values commonly required. Liquids of specially high purity were obtained with the co-operation of Professor J. Timmermans of Brussels and Dr. Herington of the Chemical Research Laboratory, Teddington, and the measurements were made by the a.c. bridge technique developed at the National Physical Laboratory for precision capacitance measurement and also by a cavity resonator method. Part I of the paper discusses the general problem and the special features of the capacitor designed to receive the liquids and surveys the results obtained. Part II gives details of the measurements made by capacitance methods at frequencies from 50 c/s to 10 kc/s, and Part III describes the measurements made at microwave frequencies. The values obtained confirm estimates of the most reliable values and their probable accuracy published in 1951 by A. A. Maryott and E. R. Smith as a result of a survey of existing data made at the National Bureau of Standards, Washington. It is considered that the new values narrow the range of uncertainty by a factor varying from 3 to 10 for the different liquids. The accuracy obtained for benzene at audio frequencies was within about 0.01%; at 9000 Mc/s the accuracy was a trifle worse but the results show clearly that although the dielectric constant exceeds the square of the optical refractive index by about 1%, no measurable diminution in dielectric constant occurs in passing from 50 c/s to 9000 Mc/s. A considerable increase in power absorption is however noticeable at 9000 Mc/s and an even greater increase at 25 000 Mc/s, and it is shown that this absorption is not entirely dependent on the water that most samples of benzene contain and that can only be removed by weeks of drying treatment. The necessity of applying such treatments is a serious disadvantage to the use of benzene as a standard liquid for measurements of dielectric constant, and cyclohexane, which is free from this disadvantage, is recommended instead.}

  abstract={It is proposed to set up a surface wave resonator consisting of a length of smooth bare wire acting as the guide and short-circuited at both ends by large flat conducting plates mounted at right angles with the guide. Energy would be supplied to the resonator at a frequency between 1000 and 40 000 Mc/s using either a coaxial or loop coupling and a similar device would be employed for the detector. From a knowledge of the guide wavelength, the frequency and the radial propagation coefficient of the wave in the air surrounding the guide, the corresponding T.E.M. wave velocity can be determined and thence c deduced for vacuum conditions. Attention is drawn to certain helpful features of the method but no attempt is made to assess its ultimate accuracy in comparison with other techniques whose value has been established for this purpose.}

The value of ( n -1)10 6 obtained for water vapour at 10 mm Hg pressure and 20°c is 60.7 which is the same as the value obtained at 24000 Mc/s, showing that the absorption line at 22000 Mc/s has a negligible effect on refractive index. The values obtained for air, oxygen and nitrogen also agree with those previously obtained within the limits of error and therefore confirm the earlier results. The values of ( n -1)10 6 obtained for hydrogen and deuterium are higher than those calculated by Ishiguro et al. by 2% and 3% respectively. The calculated values were expected to be a few per cent lower than the true values, and they are therefore supported by our experimental results.}
